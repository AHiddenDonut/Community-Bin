# this is your module file
# this is where you should write your module code
# if you want to use another file for
# let's say a special function
# make a .py file with any name you want
# and import the file here
# import example:
# from .specialfunction import *
# we use .filename to specify
# that the file is in the same directory
# and * to import all of function it has
# if you need to import an external package
# you can also do that here normally
# import time


# this is an example function
# you may delete this and make your own
# or add more function
